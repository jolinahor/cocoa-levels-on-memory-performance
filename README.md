# Cognitive Effects of Cocoa Levels on Short-Term Memory Performance - A Research Study

This study investigates whether varying cocoa percentages in chocolate enhance male memory performance using a randomized complete-block design (5 cocoa levels × 3 digestion intervals × 5 age blocks, n = 150) with participants from Colmar. Memory performance was measured before and after chocolate consumption using a timed memory game.

Results show no significant difference in completion time across cocoa levels, but digestion interval had a significant effect (p < 0.05), with shorter intervals associated with faster performance. Age was also a significant blocking factor explaining substantial variation in memory outcomes.
